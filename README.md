# twt_discord
A discord bot to emulate kpop twitter

# Set up
1. create a bot in the discord developper portal
2. fill in your token in the .env file
3. run <code>main.py</code>


# Using the bot to set up the entire server:
1. create a new discord server
2. make it a community server (link on how to do that)
3. use the <code>/server</code> command to automatically set up channels and categories

It's important that you do not do any changes to the newly made server in order for everything to work properly and as intended.
